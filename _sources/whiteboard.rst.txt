##############################
Collaborative Editing
##############################

Many users can edit at the same time, see what the others are doing in real time, and center their view at the location of another's cursor.

##############################
Countdown Timers
##############################

Add countdown timers to keep meetings and discussions on schedule.

##############################
Cut or Copy and Paste
##############################

Select objects within a rectangular area and cut or copy them, then paste to the same whiteboard or a different whiteboard you already have open.

########################
Edges
########################

Create edges (arrows) between all objects.


########################
Frames
########################

Use frames to group objects and organize the whiteboard into sections.


.. _whiteboard-hashtags:

########################
Hashtags
########################

You can put hashtags on notes, e.g. :code:`#foo` and search for those as well, or put :code:`-` (minus sign) in front to exclude matching items from search, e.g. :code:`-#foo`. You can search for regular expressions by enclosing them in slashes, for example ``/^# /``.

########################
Icons
########################

Choose from a wide selection of Icons to add to your whiteboard.


.. _jupyter-cells:

##########################
Jupyter Cells
##########################

A CoCalc whiteboard can include Jupyter code cells. Whiteboard code cells allow:

* over a dozen supported kernels
* CoCalc's massive library of pre-installed software
* interactive widgets
* execution order determined by a directed graph

.. _pages-view:

##########################

There's a button "+ New" that creates a new page. You can see previews of all your pages in the pages panel, and click a preview to jump to any page.

You can also see a page number in upper left of the main whiteboard, and click or edit to go to a page.

The Search panel is ordered by page number. Putting things in different pages imposes an ordering in the search.

##########################
Overview Map
##########################

Easily navigate with an overview map with two preview modes.


##########################

Choose one of the different pen shapes to draw freehand on your whiteboard. Supported pointing devices include most forms of mouse and trackpad as well as many Wacom tablets and iPencil and Apple Pencil.

##########################
Publish
##########################

You can :ref:`publish <publishing-files>` your whiteboards to the CoCalc share server.



.. _search-view:

##########################
Search View
##########################

By default, the search panel is open to the right for new whiteboards. You can also use the vertical toolbar at left and select the icon for the search panel: |search-icon|.

    search icon in toolbar opens Search view

*Search View* of a whiteboard gives you a panel that lists all text, sticky notes and code in order, with a search box at the top. You can search for text and click on any matching item to center the whiteboard on it. The ordering of items in Search View is lexicographic by the \(y,x\) coordinates: items closer to the top are listed first; items at the same height are listed left to right.


Search view can make your whiteboards easier to manage as they get larger.

.. figure:: img/wb-search-view.png

Search view works well with to-do lists. To find all not done items, put :code:`"[ ]"` (note the quotes) in the search box. To find all completed items, search for :code:`"[x]"`.

If you don't see a menu choice for Search View in a current whiteboard, then refresh your browser, click the "split vertically" button (upper right), then click the dropdown that says "Whiteboard" and change it to "Search".

##############################
Split Whiteboard Windows
##############################

Infinitely split whiteboard windows horizontally and vertically to view multiple parts of the whiteboard simultaneously.


##############################
Sticky Notes
##############################

A sticky note is a rectangle for enclosing text. When creating a sticky note, it's easy to select from a variety of eye-catching background colors and text fonts and sizes.

##############################
Stopwatches
##############################

Add stopwatches to the whiteboard to time activities and track work.

##############################
Table of Contents
##############################

You can view contents as an outline in a panel on the left and click to view any item instantly.

##############################
TimeTravel
##############################

As with other native CoCalc applications, every change is recorded via browsable :doc:`time-travel` You can see what changed, and who changed it, and copy/paste from any point in the history.


.. _to-do-lists:

##########################
To-do Lists
##########################

In a sticky note, text, etc., you can mark action items by placing a pair of brackets in the item, preceded and followed by a space and with a space between the brackets. The item will be displayed with an empty checkbox. Click the checkbox when the item is done, or place an "x" between the brackets, and it will show as a checked item.

.. note::

    At this time, the only way to export an image of all or part of a whiteboard is by taking a screenshot. Exporting a whiteboard to a pdf, png, or svg file is not yet implemented. See `CoCalc issue #6024 <https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/6024>`_.
